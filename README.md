# Bacterial transcriptomics in LSMMG

## 1. Bacterial strains and conditions
+ _Cronobacter sakazakii_ ATCC 29544
+ _Enterobacter cloacae_ ATCC 13047

Each strain was cultured in LSMMG (low shear modeled micro-gravity) and NG (normal gravity).


## 2. Library preparation & Sequencing
+ RNA prep: RNA was extracted using QiAGEN RNA mini-prep kit.
+ RNA library prep: rRNA-depleted total RNA library was prepared using Zymo-Seq RiboFreeÂ® Total RNA Library Kit (Zymo Research).
+ Sequencing: MiSeq, Reagent V3 (300 PE)
+ Actual yield: 14.57GB
+ % PF: 92.42%
+ % >= Q30: 88.98%

## 3. Read adapter trimming & alignment
+ Adapter trimming and alignment were conducted in Galaxy server [workflow](https://usegalaxy.org.au/u/cmkim/w/copy-of-deg-from-bacterial-rna-sequecing-result)
+ Trim Galore! (Galaxy Version 0.6.7+galaxy0) was used.
+ Trmmed reads were aligned to reference genome by BWA-MEM2 (Galaxy Version 2.2.1+galaxy1).
+ Reference genomes used: GCF_000982825.1 (_C. sakazakii_), GCF_000025565.1 (_E. cloacae_)


## 4. DEG analysis
+ DEG analysis was carried out using edgeR, as described in [here](https://github.com/igchoi/IBT618-SystemsBiotechnology/tree/main/2024-spring/msan) with a few modifications.
+ non-coding RNAs such as tRNA, rRNA, miRNA, lncRNA were excluded in analysis.
+ **Condition1: LSMMG; Condition2:NG**
