## 1. Bacterial strains and conditions
+ _Cronobacter sakazakii_ ATCC 29544
+ _Enterobacter cloacae_ ATCC 13047
+ _Citrobacter freundii_ KCTC 2195

Each strain was cultured in LSMMG (low shear modeled micro-gravity) and NG (normal gravity).  
Replicates 1, 2 and 3 of _C. sakazakii_ and _E. cloacae_ were from [previous RNA-seq result](https://github.com/cmkim1/BRL/blob/main/RNAseq240618.md).  

## 2. Library preparation & Sequencing
+ RNA prep: RNA was extracted using QiAGEN RNA mini-prep kit.
+ RNA library prep: rRNA-depleted total RNA library was prepared using Zymo-Seq RiboFreeÂ® Total RNA Library Kit (Zymo Research).
+ Sequencing: MiSeq, Reagent V3 (300 PE)
+ Actual yield: 14.64GB
+ % PF: 90.50%
+ % >= Q30: 84.53%
