# Bacterial transcriptomics in LSMMG

## 1. Bacterial strains and conditions
+ _Cronobacter sakazakii_ ATCC 29544
+ _Enterobacter cloacae_ ATCC 13047
+ _Citrobacter freundii_ KCTC 2195

Each strain was cultured in LSMMG (low shear modeled micro-gravity) and NG (normal gravity).  
Replicates 1, 2 and 3 of _C. sakazakii_ and _E. cloacae_ were from [previous RNA-seq result](https://github.com/cmkim1/BRL/blob/main/RNAseq240618.md).
