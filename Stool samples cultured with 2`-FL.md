# Bacterial metatranscriptomics in LSMMG

## 1. Samples and conditions
+ Stool samples from adult.

3 replicates of stools samples were cultured in rich medium supplemented with 2-fucosyllactose (2`-FL) in LSMMG (low shear modeled micro-gravity) and NG (normal gravity).  

## 2. Library preparation & Sequencing
+ RNA prep: RNA was extracted using QiAGEN RNA mini-prep kit.
+ Library prep: Zymo-Seq RiboFreeÂ® Total RNA Library Kit (Zymo Research).
+ Sequencing: MiSeq, Reagent V2 (150 PE)
+ Total reads: 13,212,487
+ % PF: 98.131%
+ % >= Q30: 94.53%

## 3. Assembly, alignment, DEG analysis  
All processes were conducted in Galaxy server.  
Whole reads were assembled to make transcript contigs and used as reference sequences.
+ Assembly: rnaSPAdes (Galaxy Version 3.15.5+galaxy3)
+ Annotation: Prokka (Galaxy Version 1.14.6+galaxy1)
+ Alignment: BWA-MEM2 (Galaxy Version 2.2.1+galaxy1)
+ Count: featureCounts (Galaxy Version 2.0.3+galaxy2)
+ DEG analysis: edgeR (Galaxy Version 3.36.0+galaxy4)
